	<h1>Favorite Youtubers</h1>
<p> My favorite Youtubers are DanTDM, Stampy, and Game Theory. To me, they are the best Youtubers out there.  DanTDM, Stampy, and Game Theory are the first 3 Youtubers that I enjoyed watching. Their videos are funny and unique. 
DanTDM like to play around and make people's day. 
Stampy likes to make people to laugh and make people happy. 
Game Theory like to do theories on video games and find the hidden lore in those games.

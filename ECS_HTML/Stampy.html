<p> Stampy is a Minecraft Youtuber. He make videos in his Minecraft world called "My lovely world" and in other worlds or servers. He also like to play with his friends. He also does play other games too. One of the games that Stampy played that is not Minecraft is Minecraft Story Mode.

Stampy's most popular Youtube video is called "Sinking Feeling". 

My two favorite videos from Stampy are "Stampy Vs Hit The Target - The Story So Far" and "Minecraft Xbox - Hero Helpers [542]".

<p> Game Theory not only does theories on video games, he plays them too. Game Theory doesn't give up until he finds the lore of the game that he doing a theory on. Game Theory did a lot of theory on so many games. Some of the games he did theories on and played are FNAF, Hello Neighbour, Minecraft, Hello Puppets, and so much more.

Game Theory's most popular video on Youtube is "Can Gamers SURVIVE the Real Mirror's Edge? - Game Lab".

My two favorite videos from Game Theory are "Game Theory: Among Us, The 300 IQ Impostor Strategy That Wins EVERY TIME" and "Game Theory: The Animals in Animal Crossing Aren't Animals! (Animal Crossing: New Horizons)"

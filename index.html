<p>My favorite movie is Ghost Busters Afterlife. Love it. It shows what happen after many years went by since the last ghostbusters with the whole group. One of the ghostbusters had grandchildern and the grandchildern stopped a really bad ghost. That is so cool! </p>
<h2>Major Characters</h2>
<p>One of the characters is 
Phoebe Spengler. She is the granddaughter of the Ghostbuster Egon. </p>
<p class="fancy">Another character is Podcast. Podcast is a kid who does broadcast on the supernatral and the unknown. </p>
<p>A great character is Gozer. Gozer is a evil god who wants to take over the world. Spooky. </p>
